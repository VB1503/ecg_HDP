    st.markdown("The comprehensive nature of the proposed system underscores its significance in revolutionizing the diagnostic process for cardiovascular problems. In the conventional healthcare setting, the interpretation of electrocardiogram (ECG) charts demands extensive training, while the manual examination of paper records proves to be both time-consuming and laborious. The primary objective of this project is to harness the power of machine learning methodologies to streamline and automate the conversion of traditional paper-based ECG records into efficient digital 1-D signals. This transformative approach is geared towards enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of cardiovascular diagnosis.")
    st.markdown("The intricate process begins with the extraction of pivotal components such as the P, QRS, and T waves from the ECG signals. The original ECG report is systematically divided into 13 leads, each subsequently transformed into digital signals. To ensure signal quality, smoothing techniques are meticulously applied. The signals then undergo a transformation into binary images using advanced thresholding methods. Feature extraction assumes a crucial role in this process, with dimension reduction techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) employed to gain a nuanced understanding of the data and capture pertinent information.")
    st.markdown("At the heart of the proposed system lies the implementation of multiple machine learning classifiers, namely k-nearest neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and a Voting-Based Ensemble Classifier. These classifiers are diligently trained to predict cardiac conditions based on the extracted features from the digitized ECG signals. Rigorous evaluation is conducted using key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and support. The final selection of the model hinges on meeting predefined criteria for these metrics, thereby ensuring the reliability and efficacy of the diagnostic tool.")
    st.markdown("In practical terms, the system's objective is to diagnose patients for specific cardiac conditions, with a focus on the detection of Myocardial Infarction, identification of Abnormal Heartbeat patterns, and affirmation of a healthy cardiac state. The automation of the ECG analysis process brings forth numerous advantages, including heightened efficiency, a reduction in manual effort, and early detection of potential cardiac issues. The anticipated outcomes of the proposed system encompass accurate and consistent diagnoses, improved accessibility to ECG analysis, and the establishment of a streamlined approach to cardiovascular health assessment.")
